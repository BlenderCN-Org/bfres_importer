For bones: maybe "Smooth Mtx Idx" is really "group ID", to correspond with the vertex groups. So instead of adding 2, we use the bone that has the matching group ID.
Maybe "smooth matrix" is just someone's way of describing the whole vertex group/weight thing, and they don't really refer to a matrix?
