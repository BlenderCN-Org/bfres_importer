Nintendo BFRES importer (and eventually exporter) for Blender.
Imports models from games such as Breath of the Wild.
Currently only supports Switch formats (and probably not very well).
Based on https://github.com/Syroot/io_scene_bfres
Very much in development and may be full of bugs and rough corners.
